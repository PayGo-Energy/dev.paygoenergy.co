If you do not agree with the terms, do not access or use the Services. The PayGo Energy App is built as a Commercial app for internal use ONLY. This SERVICE is provided by PayGo Energy and is intended for use as is.\n\nThe PayGo Energy service asks for and stores some of your personal contact information that you provide voluntarily. Our service also collects and analyses service usage data across all its users.\n\nIf you choose to use our Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that we collect is used for providing and improving the Service. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.\n\nThis Privacy Policy explains what data is recorded in each category and how this data is used. This spans all our applications.\n\n## Personal Information\n\nYou provide personally identifiable information when you sign up for our service. When you sign up via a third-party authentication provider (like Google), our service retrieves and saves some information about you from the provider. The specific information is controlled by the authentication provider and by the permissions you approve when you sign up. In particular, our service retrieves your email address and your user photo.\n\n**Your personally identifiable information will not be sold or rented to third parties in a way that identifies you as an individual.** In the event that we are acquired by another company, your personally identifiable information may be part of the assets transferred to the acquiring party.\n\nWe may share anonymised, aggregated order information with third parties as a way to understand, explain, and analyse our business (e.g., X% of our users used feature Y).\n\n## Application Data\n\nThe data that PayGo Energy collects and uses reside in a third-party storage provider. Our service does not persist this data. However, in order to improve performance, we may temporarily cache data, images, and other files.\n\nOur mobile client is designed to work offline. As a result, all application data that the client uses can be cached locally. This data is typically not visible to other applications on the mobile device. There is one exception to this: photos taken by the user on the device are also stored in the camera roll on the device, where they are visible to other applications. This is done to make photograph management convenient for users.\n\n## Usage Data\n\nOur service may send notifications via email and other notification mechanisms. We may employ clear gifs to track the effectiveness of our emails.\n\nWe collect location data to improve the service delivery of LPG.\n\nWe collect data on organizational assets such as LPG cylinders.\n\nWe may utilise multiple third-party products and services to help understand and analyse usage data on our site. Each such third-party service has its own privacy policy. PayGo Energy commits to review third parties that receive information from PayGo Energy to certify their compliance to Privacy Shield Principles.\n\nWe may share anonymised, non-personally identifiable usage data with third-party partners to understand, analyse, or explain aggregate customer usage of our service.\n\n## Data Security and Durability\n\nWe store user personal information and access tokens in databases hosted by cloud-computing hosting providers. We take reasonable technical steps to protect your information, including the use of passwords, OAuth, secure HTTP, etc. However, we cannot guarantee that your information is immune to a breach in the security and privacy mechanisms implemented by us and the hosting providers. If at any moment a breach of information occurs, we will notify the affected users via email within 72 hours after a confirmed incident.\n\n## How we use your information\n\nPayGo Energy will use your information to:\n\n* Correlate the transactions and movement of assets to a particular employee for operational reasons only.\n* Improve the PayGo Energy service.\n* As required by applicable law, legal process, or regulation.\n\nInformation about your usage of the platform helps us improve PayGo Energy’s service. We may also use your personal information in response to lawful requests when applicable by law, legal process, or regulation.\n\nUpon request, PayGo Energy will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information. PayGo Energy retains your data while you are a customer and use our service and will delete your personal information upon written request. You may also send requests about your contact preferences, changes, and deletions to your information including requests to opt-out of sharing your personal information with third parties by emailing software@paygoenergy.co  PayGo Energy will respond within a reasonable time frame to any request to delete your information.\n\n## Changes to the Privacy Policy\n\nOur service is evolving rapidly. As our services and products evolve, we may make changes to our privacy policy and reserve the right to do so. If we change this privacy policy, we will make a note of it on our site and send you an email communication with the updates. Your continued use of our service indicates that you agree to our changes.\n"}))}}}]);
